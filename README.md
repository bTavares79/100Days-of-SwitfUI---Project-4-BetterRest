# 100Days-of-SwitfUI---Project-4-BetterRest
Project 4 completed better rest app with challenges. Used CoreML to determine the proper amount of sleep base on when you want to wake up, desired hours of sleep and the number of cups of cofffe you had that day. 


Challenges

1. Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? 
2. Replace the “Number of cups” stepper with a Picker showing the same range of values.
3. Change the user interface so that it always shows their recommended bedtime using a nice and large font. You should be able to remove the “Calculate” button entirely.
